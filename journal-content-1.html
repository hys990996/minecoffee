                    <div class="content">Why is it so tricky to brew a great pour over coffee? After all, at its heart,
                        making a pour over is a simple process—pouring hot water over ground coffee dissolves flavor and
                        aromatic compounds in the beans. The challenge lies in dissolving only the right kinds of
                        compounds in coffee—and in the right proportion. To make a perfect pour over coffee is to find a
                        coffee’s “sweet spot,” a balance of the extraction percentage and strength level we consider
                        most delicious.</div>

                <div class="subtitle">Coffee Strength and Extraction</div>
                <div class="content">When it comes to understanding strength and extraction, we find it helpful to
                    compare coffee to a spice cupboard. Much in the same way spices are stowed away in a cupboard, an
                    array of delicious flavors—aka volatile and soluble compounds—are locked inside roasted coffee
                    beans. To be exact, coffee contains on average 30 percent soluble compounds and 70 percent insoluble
                    compounds. But like any cook’s cupboard, it also contains a handful of flavors we don’t want—or want
                    only in limited quantities—particularly bitter compounds that impart flavors of ash, tobacco, or
                    carbon. What’s so fun about making a pour over coffee is how much control it gives you in pulling
                    out exactly the right flavors at exactly the right ratio. It’s the Michelin-starred chef of coffee
                    brew methods. </div>

            <div class="other-paragraph-section">
                <div class="subtitle">Coffee Strength </div>
                <div class="content">The concentration or intensity of flavor in a cup is what we refer to as coffee
                    strength. On the palate, a coffee’s strength registers on a spectrum between watery and dense. In
                    scientific terms, it can be measured by the percentage of dissolved coffee to water, a measurement
                    we call the total dissolved solubles, or TDS.
                    <br>
                    For example, a well-made espresso has a TDS of between 9 and 20 percent coffee to water. By
                    comparison, the more mellow pour over coffee has a much lower TDS of between 1 and 2 percent coffee
                    to 98 to 99 percent water.
                    <br>
                    Strength is largely influenced by the amount of coffee you brew. In barista terms, this is referred
                    to as the brew ratio or coffee dose. In lay terms, the more coffee you brew, the stronger the cup.
                    At Blue Bottle, to set accurate brew ratios, we use gram scales to measure both our coffee and our
                    water.
                    <br>
                    And we set individual brew ratios for all our coffees: We prefer our blends slightly stronger, to
                    stand up to milk, so we generally brew them at 30 grams coffee per 350 grams water. We prefer our
                    single origins more nuanced and expressive, so we “turn down the volume” a bit and keep their brew
                    ratio slightly lower, at 22 to 24 grams coffee per 350 grams water.
                    <br>
                    If this seems like a lot to remember, a good way to assess a coffee’s strength is to judge its body.
                    That is, the weight and feel of the coffee on your tongue. Does the coffee feel light like skim milk
                    or heavy like whipping cream?

            <div class="other-paragraph-section">

                <div class="subtitle">Coffee Extraction </div>
                <div class="content">Picture a cup of tea: Steep it too little and it will taste like water. Steep it
                    too much and you have tar. Coffee behaves much the same way. Extraction is a measure of the quality
                    of the solubles in coffee, which emerge at different rates the longer you brew. Those rates are
                    influenced by time, temperature, and ratio of ground coffee to water. An underextracted coffee
                    tastes sour. An overextracted cup is overwhelmed with bitter, even burnt flavors.
                    <br>
                    Ground coffee contains at most about 30 percent soluble compounds; the remaining 70 percent are
                    fiber and other compounds that water cannot penetrate. But if you dissolve all 30 percent, your cup
                    will not taste good. In a properly extracted cup of coffee, only between 18 and 22 percent of the
                    coffee’s solubles have dissolved.
                    <br>
                    In pour over coffee, extraction is shaped by pour rate and pour patterns. It’s also impacted by
                    grind size. Grind your beans too fine and the water will pass too slowly through the coffee,
                    extracting too many bitter compounds. Grind them too coarse and the water will rush past the best
                    flavor compounds, leaving you with a coffee that tastes only sour, not sweet or radiant. Grind your
                    beans just right, and the optimal flavor compounds will dissolve in the water, leaving the
                    undesirable flavors behind.
                    <br>
                    If this all seems like a lot to remember, a good way to assess extraction is by the coffee’s finish.
                    Once you’ve finished a cup of coffee, pay attention to whether or not you can still experience its
                    flavors. We often describe finish in terms of duration, how long the taste lingers, and texture, the
                    feel of it in your mouth. Is the finish fleeting or does it linger? Does it feel smooth or rough?

            <div class="other-paragraph-section">
                <div class="subtitle">Finding a Pour Over Coffee’s Sweet Spot </div>
                <div class="content">The trick to any method of coffee brewing is to hit the sweet spot—to balance a
                    coffee’s strength and extraction percentage to achieve one delicious cup.
                    <br>
                    Now that you have an understanding of brew theory and the concepts of strength and extraction, we
                    recommend you practice making a pour over coffee, perhaps altering the coffee-to-water ratio to see
                    how flavors can either become more distinct (with more more water) or more opaque and textured, as
                    happens with the addition of more coffee grounds. Notice if you have a preferred strength. Do your
                    preferences depend on the kind of coffee you’re making, whether a lighthearted single origin or a
                    hefty blend?
                    <br>
                    Play with the extraction quality, too, by honing your pour over coffee skills, from dialing in the
                    grind to pour technique. Somewhere in this quest you’ll start to notice that your coffee becomes
                    more resonant, with every aspect of it coming into clearer focus. Like notes played on a tuned-up
                    piano, individual flavors start to ring, until the entire coffee, from its mouthfeel to its finish,
                    hums like a chord progression.
